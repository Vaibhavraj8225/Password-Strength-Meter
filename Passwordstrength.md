📌 Step-by-Step Execution
1. Created Sample Passwords with Varying Complexity
Password #	Password	Complexity Used
1	password123	  Lowercase + numbers
2	Password123	  Uppercase + lowercase + numbers
3	Pass@123	  Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol
4	P@$$w0rd2025!	  Complex: Upper, lower, numbers, symbols
5	V9#xZ!t8@rGqL	  High entropy: Random mix, 12+ characters
________________________________________
2. Evaluated Password Strength Using Online Tools
Tool Used: PasswordMeter.com
Password #	Password	Score (%)	Strength Label	Feedback
1	password123	 26%	Weak	Too common, lacks complexity
2	Password123	 53%	Moderate	Better, but still guessable
3	Pass@123	 63%	Good	Decent, try increasing length
4	P@$$w0rd2025!	 87%	Strong	Complex and long
5	V9#xZ!t8@rGqL	 100%	Very Strong	High entropy, hard to guess

💡 Tips Learned from Evaluation
•	Longer passwords are more secure.
•	Avoid common patterns and dictionary words.
•	Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases strength.
•	Avoid personal information (birthdays, names).
•	Randomly generated passwords with 12+ characters are best.

🧠 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1.	Use at least 12–16 characters.
2.	Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3.	Avoid using real words, names, or predictable patterns.
4.	Never reuse passwords across sites.
5.	Use a password manager to store and generate passwords.
6.	Change passwords regularly for sensitive accounts.

🛡️ Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description
Brute Force	Tries all possible combinations until correct password is found.
Dictionary Attack	Uses a list of common words or passwords to guess the right one.
Phishing	Tricks user into revealing password.
Credential Stuffing	Uses leaked credentials from one site to access others.

🔍 How Password Complexity Affects Security
•	Simple passwords can be cracked in seconds using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
•	Complex passwords take exponentially more time to crack, especially with special characters and randomness.
•	Adding just a few characters significantly increases the number of possible combinations (entropy).
________________________________________
🎯 Outcome
•	Learned how password complexity directly influences security.
•	Evaluated and compared multiple passwords using an online tool.
•	Understood the importance of using strong, unique passwords for every account.
