üîê Password Strength Evaluation
Overview
This project demonstrates how to create strong passwords and evaluate their effectiveness using online tools like passwordmeter.com. The objective is to understand what makes a password strong and how complexity affects security against common attacks.

Steps Performed
Created multiple passwords with varying complexity.

Tested each password using an online password strength checker.

Documented scores, feedback, and comparison results.

Identified best practices for strong password creation.

Researched common password attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

Key Takeaways
Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols offer better protection.

Avoid common words, personal data, and predictable patterns.

Use a password manager for strong, unique passwords.

Complex passwords significantly improve resistance against attacks.

Conclusion
Through this task, we gained practical insights into password security. Strong passwords are a critical defense against cyber threats. By evaluating real examples, we understood the direct impact of password complexity on strength and resilience. Following best practices can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
